### What is this?

This is a [chrome extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome_extension) to automate the downloading of resources.

This is a component that sends the links for a [python flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) service called [omxclient](http://git.balhau.net/omxpiclient.git) which do the work of downloading the resources and save them in a local [samba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block) shared folder.
